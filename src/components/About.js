      Hello visitor!! Thank you for visiting my website. Here is a little bit about myself. I am a Software Developer with 6+ plus years of experience. I specialize in web application development and work mostly on

      I was born and raised in India with most of my childhood spent in Hyderabad and Bangalore. I received my Bachelors degree in Computer Science from Amrita School of Engineering in Bangalore. Post graduation, I worked as a Software QA analyst (Automation tester experienced with Lisa automation tool) at Accenture Services Pvt. Ltd. for two years.
      After my two year tenure at Accenture, I moved to the United States to pursue Masters in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Arlington. After graduation, I started working with Wolfram Research Inc. in Champaign, Illinois and have been working with them ever since. I also worked at the Wolfram UK office for almost an year.

      I am currently working on a travel blog that should be up anytime soon. My other hobbies include photography and cooking.
